# AmazonPA-Data

Amazon CD Twitter Bot:

The bot was made for public use. The bot's main feature is tweet some of the best deals currently on Amazon. Using Google Cloud's mySQL database and Heroku deployment servers, the bot is able to grab and parse data from Amazon. The code is heavy Python and it populates the database with data from a headless chromium browser by using selenium. The database is constantly being updated and comparing prices. The tweeting python file is also constantly running and makes a post every 40 seconds to follow twitter's rate limits.
